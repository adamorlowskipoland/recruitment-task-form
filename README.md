# recruitment-task-form
This is a recruitment task to code psd into html/css/js according to specifications.  
In Example folder you can find images showing how the finished product should look like.



Requirements:  
- Box must be centered vertically and horizontally  
- The .psd file also shows a mobile version of the site. Page must be responsive (we do not impose specific breakpoints).  
- Font should match the one from the .psd file. If you can't, use similar font, found on the web.  
- Something must happend when user presses button (eg. basic form validation).  
- Animation from .mp4 is not required. It's enough that the middlo box is animated when you load in 'fade in' or similar subtle way.
